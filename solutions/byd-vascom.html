      <h3>Immersion Liquid Cooling</h3>
      <p>
        By fully submerging servers in a proprietary, non-conductive liquid, heat is absorbed directly from critical components, eliminating reliance on traditional air-conditioning systems. 
        This immersion approach not only reduces energy consumption and maintenance overhead but also enhances operational stability by maintaining consistent thermal conditions, making it ideal for high-density AI and HPC environmen

      <h3>BYD Reech Modular Server</h3>
      <p>
        <b> Business Value:</b> The Reech Server represents a next-generation computing solution designed to deliver maximum performance for AI, HPC, and edge workloads while aligning with sustainability goals.
        Integrated with VASCOM’s full-stack immersion liquid cooling ecosystem, it enables enterprises to reduce operational costs by up to 35%, achieve near-parity with traditional air-cooled investments, 
        and significantly lower energy consumption. This platform empowers data centers to scale intelligently, optimize PUE, and future-proof infrastructure for high-density computing demands.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <b> Technical Value:</b> Built for immersion environments, the Reech Server leverages modular architecture and advanced thermal design to support configurations of up to 16 GPUs with optimized flow-field cooling. 
        Its lightweight structure, centralized Busbar power system, and BIOS/BMC adaptations ensure seamless integration into single-phase immersion systems. 
        Combined with VASCOM’s CDU and cooling tower solutions, the platform maintains chip temperatures below 70°C, delivers up to 180kW heat dissipation per rack, and supports intelligent monitoring for real-time performance and energy optimization.

      <h3>Seamless Data Center Integration</h3>
      <p>
        <b> Business Value:</b> The modular plug-and-play design allows enterprises to deploy cutting-edge cooling technology seamlessly across both new and existing data centers. 
        This reduces deployment time, eliminates the need for large-scale facility upgrades, and delivers immediate cost savings. 
        Organizations can modernize faster, operate more sustainably, and respond quickly to evolving business and regulatory demands,
        all while lowering total cost of ownership (TCO).
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <b> Technical Value:</b>Engineered for flexibility and scalability, the system integrates easily into diverse rack and power configurations without major redesigns. 
        Each module is optimized for high thermal efficiency, enabling precise heat management, improved equipment longevity, and consistent performance under intensive AI or GPU workloads. 
        Its modular architecture ensures simplified maintenance, easy expansion, and compatibility with future technology upgrades.
